# AsyncAPI Documentation

Welcome to the AsyncAPI documentation section.

## Overview

This section contains AsyncAPI specifications and documentation for event-driven architectures and messaging systems.

## What is AsyncAPI?

AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that provides a specification for describing asynchronous APIs, particularly event-driven architectures. It's similar to OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) but focused on async communication patterns.

## Available Documentation

- [AsyncAPI Specifications](specs.md) - Complete list of API specifications

## Benefits

- Standardized way to document event-driven APIs
- Tooling support for code generation and validation
- Better understanding of message formats and channels
- Integration with development workflows
